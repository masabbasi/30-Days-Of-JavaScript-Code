					The accordion is a graphical control element comprising a vertically stacked list of items, such as labels or
					thumbnails. Each item can be "expanded" or "collapsed" to reveal the content associated with that item. There
					can be zero expanded items, exactly one, or more than one item expanded at a time, depending on the
					configuration.

					It isn't too hard to learn the accordion. With daily practice, you should start to get comfortable in about 3
					or
					4 months. The hard part about learning how to play accordion is making your hands work independently â€“
					pressing
					the keys and buttons while moving the bellows back and forth.
